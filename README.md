=============

Pure Data live looping/sampling application

4 loop banks - these can play either pre-recorded sound files or record live sound to be looped.

The coolest part? Set the BPM tempo and a number of beats (e.g. 8 or 16) and all loops and samples will automatically get in time.

Currently set up to use Touch Pads and Rotary Controls from a Samson Graphite M25, but should be easy to configure with other hardware.
